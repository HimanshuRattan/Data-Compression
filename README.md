# Data-Compression
The following code will convert an 8 bit image to a 3 bit image. 
<p>
  <img src="lena.jpg" height="256px" width="256px" title="Before Compression" alt="Before Compression"><br>
  <p>This is the image before compression</p><br>
  <img src="lena_2.jpg" height="256px" width="256px" title="After Compression" alt="After Compression"><br>
  <p>This is the image after compression</p><br>
  
  The original photo was 42.1 KB whereas the compressed image is only 4.86 KB.<br>
  (Note that this is a lossy compression)<br>
  The program uses numpy and PIL library to do the same.
